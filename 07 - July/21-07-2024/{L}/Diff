- 
  Welcome to ECAT {L} - Introduction to the Legislature
- 
  Today we’ll be looking at the Legislative Branch of the UK.
- 
  Please stay seated and don’t speak unless asked.
- 
  I’d advise you to make note of this information as it’ll be important for the quiz.
- 
  Are there any questions before we begin?
- 
  Answer any questions
  
  
- 
  The Legislative Branch is one of the four main branches of the UK,
- 
  and is otherwise collectively known as ’The Houses of Parliament’.
- 
  The branch is split into The House of Commons & The House of Lords.
- 
  These houses are responsible for drafting bills, which may then,
- 
  after a lengthy process (consisting of debate and discussion) be passed into law.
  
  
- 
  The House of Commons membership consists solely of MPs.
- 
  MR MPs are either 8iC or 9iC and have no further responsibilities.
- 
  HR MPs are also either Secretaries or Ministers, or aid in the running of the House.
- 
  Government Ministers are chosen by the PM,
- 
  whilst Opposition Ministers are chosen by the Opposition Leader [5iC].
- 
  The Official Opposition is a group of members who aim to challenge the Government.
- 
  Their Secretaries and Ministers ’shadow’ the Government Ministers, and critique their policy.
- 
  Any questions?
- 
  Answer any questions
  
  
- 
  Leadership consists of:
- 
  - The Speaker of the House (SotH) [4iC]: Thurgood.
- 
  - The Deputy Speaker of the House [5iC]: EriksS.
- 
  - The Leader of the Opposition [5iC]: TheHarveh.
- 
  - The Deputy Leader of the Opposition [6iC].
- 
  - The Clerk of the House [6iC] (assists in bill-drafting & record-keeping): Faiqh101.
- 
  - Opposition MP Shadow Secretaries and Ministers [7iC].
  
  
- 
  The rest of the Commons is made up of 8-9iC MPs,
- 
  each belonging to the Government, Opposition, or remaining independent.
- 
  Are there any questions?

  Answer any questions
  
  
- 
  Next, the structure of the upper-house, The House of Lords.
- 
  The Lords is made up of its leadership, Lords Temporal, and Lords Spiritual.
- 
  Its leadership consists of:
- 
  - The Lord Speaker [4iC] (presides over the House): .Martin.
- 
  - The Deputy Lord Speaker [5iC]: Josephj827.
- 
  - The Clerk of the House of Lords [6iC]: supaman981.
- 
  - Lord Shadow Secretaries and Ministers [7iC].
  
  
- 
  The rest of the House of Lords consists of:
- 
  - Lords Temporal [non-iC].
- 
  - Lords Spiritual (ex officio their position as Supreme Court Justices).
  
  
- 
  It is important to note that not all members of the House of Lords are employees.
- 
  Only those with a designated iC ranking are employees of the UK,
- 
  but all lords are otherwise given the same powers.
- 
  People can become lords by either being appointed after their tenure as an employee,
- 
  or by purchasing a peerage from HM Treasury for 150c.
- 
  Any questions?
- 
  Answer any questions
  
  
- 
  Next, how a bill becomes law.
- 
  First a bill is drafted by either a Lord, or an MP.
- 
  After it is submitted, it is announced by the Speaker during its ’First Reading’.
- 
  Next, during its ’Second Reading’, the general principles of the bill are debated and discussed.
- 
  After, it goes to the ’Committee stage’, where the bill is closely inspected,
- 
  and debated line-by-line, and amendments are voted on.
- 
  After the committee stage, there is the report stage, where the bill goes back to the House,
- 
  and it can vote on any further amendments to the bill.
- 
  During the ’Third Reading’, the House will debate the contents of the bill,
- 
  and no amendments can be made.
- 
  After the third reading, if the bill was started in the Lords, it will proceed to the Commons,
- 
  to undergo the same process.
- 
  If the bill passes the Commons’ third reading, it continues to ’Royal Assent’.
- 
  Any questions?
- 
  Answer any questions
  
  
- 
  Royal Assent is where the monarch, HM, The King Terrorization, signs the bill into law.
- 
  Royal Assent, however, is effectively a formality,
- 
  except in the case whereby the monarch would be affected by the bill.
  
  
- 
  Common activities for MPs include:
- 
  - Prime Minister’s Questions (PMQs)
- 
  - Ministerial Questions (MQs)
- 
  - Debates
- 
  - Committee Meetings
- 
  - Putting forward motions during a House session for debates or votes
  
  
- 
  PMQs & MQs are chances for MPs to ask the PM and other ministers questions surrounding policy.
- 
  PMQs is scheduled for every Saturday sitting, and MQs for Thursday’s sitting.
- 
  MPs are welcome to join committees of their choosing.
- 
  This gives them the chance to closely discuss bills during the committee stage.
- 
  However, most bills are sent to the Whole-House Committee, due to low numbers.
  
- Any questions?
