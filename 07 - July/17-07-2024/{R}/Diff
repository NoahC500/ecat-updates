  While recruiting at the front desk, there are three basic steps:
  1. Ask the civilian if they would like a job, or if they need any help.
  2. Direct them through the process of getting the appropriate badge, motto, and uniform.
! The appropriate badge for Trainees is [UK] - Employee ID. The motto is [UK] MI5 Trainee.
  3. Correct them on any mistakes, then send them to the gates for training.
  It is also advised that you personally address potential recruits, e.g. greet them by their name.
  It is preferred that all employees have their badge favourited,
