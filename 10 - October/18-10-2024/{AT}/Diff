  In addition to this, there are five orders of nobility, too used to reward.
  These are: the Orders of the Garter, the Bath, the Royal Victorian Order,
  the Order of the British Empire and the Order of the Companions of Honour.
! These all have several tiers, one’s tier of an order may be upgraded,
  rather than them being given a rank in a new order.
  
  Typically, Knighting Ceremonies are held by the Sovereign in order to award these.
  Some honours and peerages give the bearer the right to bear a medal or cape,
! these can be seen on the website under ’Learn’ > ’Medals and Peerages’.
  
! Next, I’ll give you a short quiz to assess what you’ve learnt.
! You need 5/7 to pass. If you are unsure of the correct answer, just say ’pass’.
  
  If there are multiple LRs present:
  Please whisper your answers to me and do not confer.
