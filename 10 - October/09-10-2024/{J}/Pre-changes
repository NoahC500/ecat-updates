[Notes for Agent]



Welcome to ECAT {J} - Introduction to the Judiciary.

Today we’ll be looking at the structure of the UK’s courts and its interactions with the MoJ.

Please refrain from going AFK, stay seated, and don’t speak unless asked.

If you need to ask a question, please wave by typing ’o/’.

I’d advise you to make note of this information as it’ll be important for the quiz.

Are there any questions before we begin?

Answer any questions



The Judicial Branch is one of the four main branches of the UK Government,

and is made up of three courts

The President of the Supreme Court [5iC] is the leader of the Judicial Branch.

They’re responsible for leading the branch, and do this alongside their deputy [6iC].

The current Deputy President of the Supreme Court is Reivindicatio.

The President and their deputy are supported by the rest of leadership,

which is made of up to 5 Lord Justices [6iC] & 3 Circuit Judges [7iC].

The rest of the branch is made up of 3 District Judges [8iC] and a number of Solicitors [9iC].

Any questions so far?

Answer any and all questions



The Magistrate’s Court is the lowest court, and the first one in which cases are sent to.

Here, cases are heard by a singular District Judge.

The Magistrate’s Court has limited sentencing power,

and thus has the power to escalate the case to a higher court if deemed fit.



The Crown Court is a higher court than that of the Magistrate’s.

Here cases are heard by Circuit Judges as well as a jury.

The Crown Court hears appeals from the Magistrate’s Court, as well as those referred by it.

The Court has higher sentencing power than the Magistrate’s

and hears the most serious of criminal cases (bar those with potential constitutional importance).

Any questions so far?

Answer any and all questions



The Supreme Court hears matters of ’Constitutional Importance’

and as such has great influence on the future of the UK’s policy and legislation.

The Supreme Court has the power to overturn secondary and lesser legislation.

Here, cases are heard on by an odd number of at least 3 Lord Justices,

which are ex officio Lords Spiritual, and can thus sit in the House of Lords.

Do not include until after the introduction of the bar

Those who wish to climb the ranks of the branch must complete the bar exam,

allowing them to be promoted to High Court Judge [8iC].

This exam is graded and set by the Ministry of Justice (MoJ) and the Lord President.

Any questions so far?

Answer any and all questions



Typical tasks for those in the Judicial Branch include Mock Trials (MTs).

This is where members of the branch act out a trial as if it were real,

while using fabricated evidence to make it more realistic.

7iC+ from Judicial are also able to train LRs via ECATs when a member of MI is unavailable.



Whilst not a part of the Judicial Branch, the MoJ’s role is tightly linked to the courts system.

The MoJ ensures that only those capable can practise law.

It also acts as the prosecution service, and is further explained in ECAT {E}.



Next, I’ll give you a short quiz to assess what you’ve learnt.

You need 3/5 to pass. If you are unsure of the correct answer, just say ’pass’.



If there are multiple LRs present:
