  Answer any questions
  
  After you have finished your shift in one of the aforementioned positions,
! you should seek the confirmation of two 7iC+ employees or one 6iC.
  If unable to obtain confirmation from someone in HQ, screenshots are made useful.
! Within the UK Discord server, (which I strongly urge you to join if you have not)
! is a channel named #duty-confirmations.
  Here you should post a link to the images online as well as pinging your branch leadership.
! ECAT submissions should be posted in #ecat-confirmations.
  
  Upon either: getting your shift confirmed in HQ, or posting in Discord,
  you must submit them, and the person who has confirmed (or your branch leadership),
! on the Duty Quota page of the site.
  This is found in the menu under your username once signed in.
