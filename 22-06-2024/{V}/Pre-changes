All employees of the Habbo United Kingdom are eligible to vote in the election for Prime Minister 1iC.
Only employees who have been employed for thirty (30) days or more may vote in these elections.
Elections for Prime Minister occur every 4 months, which means our next election is in May 2024.
If a ticket has 10+ supporters who support one nomination, it will appear on the election ballot.
Do you have any questions?
Answer any questions
If there ends up being more than 2 nominations, there will be a Ranked Choice vote,
which means all HabboUK employees vote for the Top 2 nominations to proceed forward.
If there are only 2 nominated candidates, the election proceeds straight to the General elections.
The candidate receiving the most votes shall be commissioned by HM, The King
 to become Prime Minister and form The Majesty’s Government in accordance with statute law.
The runner-up with second-most votes shall be appointed Leader of the Opposition
and shall form The Majesty’s Most Loyal Opposition in accordance with statute law.
