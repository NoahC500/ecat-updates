ECAT {N} - Navigating the Site & Discord
[To be spoken]
[Notes for Agent]


Welcome to today's ECAT session.
Today we'll be looking at navigating the HabboUK Website & Discord Server.
Any questions before we begin?
Answer any questions


First, we'll talk about the website.
You can find the website at HabboUK»com
On the site you can find information on everything Habbo UK.
Under the 'Governance' tab, you can find info on the Royal Family,
as well as the different branches and offices of the UK.


Under the 'News' tab, you can find all the latest UK press releases, along with PMQs minutes etc.
Under the 'Learn' tab, you can find Anti-Bullying policy,
HQ rules, & lists of ranks, VIPs, & Constituencies.
And on the 'Justice' page you can find info on recent and upcoming hearings.
Are there any questions?
Answer any questions


After creating an account, and logging in, you'll have access to the EE:DB, your tasks and duty quota, as well as account settings.
All the account related pages are found to the right of the menu bar, and hovering over icons will tell you what they mean.
EE:DB stands for 'Employee Database', it holds all the info on current and past UK employees, and is used to promote LRs.
Your dashboard page is found under the name of your branch,
and shows your weekly stats, branch announcements and scripts & handbooks if relevant.


LoAs (Leave of Absence) requests can be made via the website.
Under the drop-down with your username, there's an LoA button.
However, it is not currently functional, so you should contact a member of your branch leadership.


Once they become 7iC, non-MI members are able to train LRs.
This includes all ECATs. This is only to be done in the case that no member of MI5 is available.
Scripts can be found on the MI5 branch portal, located next to your own.
ECATs are to be submitted at the end of the session via the form at the bottom of the page.

Now onto Discord.
The Discord server is separated into several categories, including:
Clearance, Requests, Communications & your branch's category.
'Clearance' is where you verify your Habbo account and have roles added to your Discord.
'Requests' is where you can make requests to other offices and branches.
For example, you may ping MI5 to get someone to train a new recruit.
Treasury requests, however, are in a separate HM Treasury section.
'Communications' is for general chat.
Your branch will also have its own category for announcements, discussion & anything else they need.


It is asked that the rules laid out in #terms-conditions are abided by,
and that no NSFW content is posted in the Discord server and that it is kept ’PG-13’.


I'm going to give you a quiz to see what you've learned from this session.
Any questions before we start it?
Answer any questions
You need 2/3 correct to pass. If you are unsure of the answer, say ’pass’.


Say the following line only if multiple LRs are in attendance.
Please whisper your answers to me and don't confer.
