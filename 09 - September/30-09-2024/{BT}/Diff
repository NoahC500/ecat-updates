+ When filling the front, if you see a potential recruit, greet them.
+ Address them by their name and ask if they’d like a job.
+ If they would, inform them that they should change their motto to: [UK] MI Trainee,

+ The uniform will be automatically equipped when being sent to the training rooms.
+ However, this is a temporary change;
+ when they next change their appearance the uniform will be taken off.
+ This is why it is recommended they wear the uniform from the mannequin.
+ All employees should also be encouraged to join the Employee ID badge found on the group pennant.
+ However, if you suspect someone of trolling, you may decline to hire them.
