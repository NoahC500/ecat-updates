  First, we’ll talk about passwords.
! A strong password is completely impersonal, i.e. no pet names, DOBs, or your name.
! You should always use a unique password (made up of numbers, letters, & symbols),
! for each website/app.
! This is so that if one gets leaked, not all your accounts are compromised.
  
  
! It is recommended to use a local, and encrypted password manager,
! in order to store your randomly generated passwords.
! 
! 
! 2. Multi-Factor Authentication
  Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA/2FA) is a security practice which forces the user to enter,
  both their password, and at least one more ’factor’.
  This could be a code generated by an app (such as Authy), or sent via SMS or email,
! or some form of biometric identification.
! MFA via SMS is not recommended as it is relatively easy to effectively intercept these codes.
! It is recommended to use MFA on all platforms which support it, including Habbo.

! 3. Social Media
  It is important to be wary of what we post online,
  as it can allow strangers to view what we do in our day-to-day lives.
! This can be dangerous as you could potentially reveal where you live, work,
! or where you can otherwise be found.
! This is why we recommend keeping personal social media accounts ’private’,
  as well as not accepting friend requests from those you don’t know.
  
  
! 4. Habbo
! It is important that, no matter how nice you believe people to be on Habbo,
! that you don’t reveal your personal information with them.
! It’s really nice to find online friends and we for sure encourage it,
! however, please don’t give your personal socials etc. to these new friends.
  This is due to the fact that you really don’t know who is ’behind the screen’,
  and the last thing you want is for your privacy and/or personal spaces to be invaded.

! 5. Antimalware & Updating
! Most modern devices will come pre-installed with antimalware software (e.g. Windows Defender).
  This software’s job is to find, quarantine, and remove malicious software which could
  send your personal information to an attacker or hack any of your accounts.
! Thus, it’s important that these programs be kept up-to-date.
  You should also ensure that your computer has all the latest security updates installed.

! or some form of biometric identification (like a fingerprint).
! SMS authentication is not recommended as it is considered very insecure,
! and it is recommended to use MFA on all platforms which support it, which includes Habbo.
