ECAT {O} Online Security
[To be spoken]
[Notes for Agent]


Welcome to today's ECAT session, {O} - Online Security.
Today we'll be looking at online safety, and keeping your data secure.
Any questions before we begin?
Answer any questions


First, we’ll talk about passwords.
A strong password is completely impersonal, i.e. no pet names, DOBs, or your name.
You should always use a unique password (made up of numbers, letters, & symbols),
for each website/app.
This is so that if one gets leaked, not all your accounts are compromised.


It is recommended to use a local, and encrypted password manager,
in order to store your randomly generated passwords.


2. Multi-Factor Authentication
Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA/2FA) is a security practice which forces the user to enter,
both their password, and at least one more ’factor’.
This could be a code generated by an app (such as Authy), or sent via SMS or email,
or some form of biometric identification.
MFA via SMS is not recommended as it is relatively easy to effectively intercept these codes.
It is recommended to use MFA on all platforms which support it, including Habbo.
Any questions so far?

3. Social Media
It is important to be wary of what we post online,
as it can allow strangers to view what we do in our day-to-day lives.
This can be dangerous as you could potentially reveal where you live, work,
or where you can otherwise be found.
This is why we recommend keeping personal social media accounts ’private’,
as well as not accepting friend requests from those you don’t know.


4. Habbo
It is important that, no matter how nice you believe people to be on Habbo,
that you don’t reveal your personal information with them.
It’s really nice to find online friends and we for sure encourage it,
however, please don’t give your personal socials etc. to these new friends.
This is due to the fact that you really don’t know who is ’behind the screen’,
and the last thing you want is for your privacy and/or personal spaces to be invaded.
Are there any questions so far?

5. Antimalware & Updating
Most modern devices will come pre-installed with antimalware software (e.g. Windows Defender).
This software’s job is to find, quarantine, and remove malicious software which could
send your personal information to an attacker or hack any of your accounts.
Thus, it’s important that these programs be kept up-to-date.
You should also ensure that your computer has all the latest security updates installed.

6. Linked Accounts
It is recommended not to link personal accounts in any way to your Habbo ones.
Be that by Discord connections or otherwise.
If you log in to Habbo via Facebook it’s recommended to change your password regularly.


7. Phishing
Phishing is where someone may send you a link to a fake website or app,
or cold DM/email you, in order to collect your personal information or passwords.
It is vital that you are wary of these scams in order to keep you,
and your personal information safe.


If you’re worried in any way about your online security or safety,
then please contact a member of the Ministry of Defence, or branch leadership.
More info on online safety can be found on the HabboUK site, as well as on a variety of charities’ websites.
