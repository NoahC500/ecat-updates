[To be spoken]
[Notes for Agent]
Welcome to today's ECAT session, ECAT {U} - Uniform and Bearings.
Today we'll be looking at navigating the standards for uniforms, medals and titles within the UK.
Any questions before we begin?
Answer any questions

All employees of our organisation are required to wear professional clothing.
Professional clothing is determined by the Cabinet Office.
Low Ranks are currently required to wear one of the uniform options shown in the UK HQ Lobby.
The Military Intelligence Branch may set out a specific uniform if made official by the Director General.
If someone is found not wearing professional clothing,they may bring it to the Cabinet’s attention.
The offender may then be subject to disciplinary action such as:
1. A strike or 2. A court case.
The Cabinet Office may set out specific time periods where uniform standards are temporarily relaxed.

The Habbo United Kingdom also has a Peerage System, which is decided solely by HM, The King,
but recommendations are made by the Prime Minister.
In this system, there are 5 peerages, each with their own requirements and privileges.
The peerages, in order of honour and nobility (with their eligibility requirements) are as follows:
1. Duke/Duchess (former 3iC+) 2. Marquess/Marchioness (former 4iC+)
3. Earl/Countess (former 5iC+) 4. Viscount/Viscountess (former Cabinet Minister or SC Justice)
5. Baron/Baroness (UK Veteran)

In the UK, there are five orders of decoration and nobility.
They are used to recognise UK members for their services to the Sovereign and the organisation.
There are 4 orders of chivalry and 1 order of merit.
The five orders, in order of nobility, are as follows:
1. Most Noble Order of the Garter 2. Most Honourable Order of the Bath 3. Royal Victorian Order
4. Most Excellent Order of the British Empire 5. Order of the Companions of Honour

A knighting ceremony is held by HM, The King in order to give these honours.
Once knighted, one is able to wear the medal which corresponds with their Order.
These can be viewed at HabboUK»com under the Learn tab, by clicking Medals and Peerages.
Additionally, anyone appointed to Order of the Garter may wear the Adorned Fantasy Cape,
along with the standard HC medal accessory.

I'm going to give you a quiz to see what you've learned from this session.
If you are unsure of the answer, say "pass”. You need 2/3 to pass.

Say the following line only if multiple LRs are in attendance.
Please whisper your answers to me and don't confer.

Are we ready to start?
