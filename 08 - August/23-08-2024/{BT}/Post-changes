[Notes for Agent]

Welcome to ECAT {BT} - Basic Training.
Please refrain from going AFK, stay seated, and don’t speak unless asked.
If you need to ask a question, please wave by typing ’o/’.
I’d advise you to make note of this information as it’ll be important for the quiz.

Throughout your time within the UK, to progress, you will be required to pass a series of ECATs.
This stands for Education, Certification and Training,
these sessions will give you the info you need to be an effective employee.
Again, this is the Basic Training ECAT,
thusly it will inform you of the basic rules of our establishment,
as well as its structure and the duties you may need to perform.

The following is basic information that all employees are expected to know:
HM, King Terrorization, is the reigning monarch and Head-of-State.
HM, Queen Rosanthe, is the Queen Consort, and the Prince of Wales is HRH, amazingconnor.
The Royal Family act as HabboUK’s founders & RC, though they play a mostly ceremonial role.

In the UK, there are Low-Rank & in-Command employees.
LRs do not have any responsibilities but are expected to work at HQ stations whenever possible.
iCs are required to log in, at minimum, every 7 days.
All iCs are members of a branch, each branch will give their members tasks to complete.
The branches are as follows:
- The Executive: Headed by the Prime Minister, it deals with all Government Policy.
- The Legislature: The Houses of Commons & Lords, members write and debate on law.
- The Judiciary: The UK Courts, handles all interpretive and criminal hearings.
- Military Intelligence (MI): Foreign & Engagement work, and training materials creation.
All four of the branches are explained in their own ECATs.

The lowest ranked iC level is nine, and the highest is one.
This forms a chain of command.

The Prime Minister [1iC] is the head of the UK Government,
and is directly elected by iC employees every four months.The current Prime Minister (PM) is Apped, the Deputy PM [2iC] is Jush.

Now for the basic rules of the UK. All employees are subject to these.
Failure to do so may result in disciplinary action, which is further outlined in ECAT {D},
but the basics are that it is a ’4 strikes and out’ system.
These rules are as follows:
1. Respect all employees/visitors and follow the Habbo Way.
2. Do not swear excessively, spam, use red or neon coloured chat, effects or dance.
3. Wear the correct uniform, badge, and motto for your rank.
4. Do not double-job and ask for rights or promotions, or promote oneself.
5. Do not enter any teles or the VIP room without authorisation.
6. Refrain from idling/going AFK while at the front desk or any other station.

Now for some of the basic commands used in HQ. They are as follows:
FTF - Fill the Front (Sit at the front desk and recruit/help others)
BTB - Back to Base (Return to HQ)
FTS/GC - Fill Sentry/Fill Gate Control (Fill the security area to allow others entry)
AE - At Ease (Return to your original position)
CTH - Clear the Halls (Sit in a room or FTF/FTS)

When called to attention, one must:
	1. Stand and face the person calling attention.
	2. Wave
	3. Say ’Yes Sir’ or ’Yes Ma’am’, or otherwise appropriately address them by their rank.
4. When told to AE, return to your original position.
Next, I’ll give you a short quiz to assess what you’ve learnt.
You need 5/7 to pass. If you are unsure of the correct answer, just say ’pass’.
