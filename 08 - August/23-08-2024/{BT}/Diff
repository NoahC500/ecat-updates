  Throughout your time within the UK, to progress, you will be required to pass a series of ECATs.

! that you will perform as a UK employee and form your basic knowledge of our Government.
  Are there any questions?
  Answer any questions
  
  The following is basic information that all employees are expected to know:
  HM, King Terrorization, is the reigning monarch and Head-of-State.
  HM, Queen Rosanthe, is the Queen Consort, and the Prince of Wales is HRH, amazingconnor.
! iC stands for ’In Command’, so the Prime Minister is 1iC & Deputy PM is 2iC. 9iC is the lowest.
! The current Prime Minister (PM) is Apped, the Deputy PM is Jush.
! When you join the UK, you are a Low-Rank (LR). LRs cannot claim pay.
! Medium-Ranks (MRs) & High-Ranks (HRs) have an iC in their motto,
! and should be addressed by their title.
! You become an MR when you join one of the four branches within the UK.
! These are the Executive, the Legislature, the Judiciary, and Military Intelligence (MI).
! One cannot join the Executive, they must be appointed to it,
! either by a current member, or by winning a General Election.
