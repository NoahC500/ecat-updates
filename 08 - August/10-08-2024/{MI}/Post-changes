Hello and welcome to today’s ECAT, {MI} - Introduction to the Military Intelligence Branch.
Today we’ll be looking at the MI branch, its function and leadership team.

Answer any questions

Military Intelligence is one of the four main branches within the UK.
The branch is responsible for keeping headquarters active, keeping employees engaged,
visiting allies and collecting foreign intelligence, as well as training.
If you join the branch from being an LR and undergoing an interview, you join as a 9iC Agent.
As a 9iC Agent, you are expected to educate members through ECATs such as these.
This includes holding Basic Training {BT} ECATs for new recruits and those transferring in.
However, as you prove yourself and rank up to 8iC Officer and higher,
you will gain new responsibilities, such as visiting foreign agencies and hosting events in HQ.

The MI branch is headed by the Director General [4iC]: NoahC500.
The Deputy Director General [5iC]: GetWild, assists the Director General in the running of the branch,
and, naturally, deputises when the role is vacant or the Dir. Gen. is on LOA.
The Personnel Director [6iC]: -nekocho-, focuses on the wellbeing of MI personnel,
as well as ensuring they complete their assigned duties.
This makes up MI Senior Leadership.
The leadership team also includes the Training Strategist [7iC],
who focuses on the development of ECATs and other training materials.

As those in MI often interact with the public,
through their hosting of events, and during training sessions,
it’s important for MI personnel to be able to show decorum and be able to be polite, etc..
One of the main goals of MI is to keep good ’Netgain’.
Which, to put simply, is the difference in the number of employees since last week.
Any questions so far?
Answer any questions

All MI personnel are able to guard the Royal Family, the Cabinet Office and foreign dignitaries
at special events, such as balls, and the State Opening of Parliament.
This is as they are able to join the Royalty and Specialist Protection force (RASP).
RASP is jointly-headed by the Directors General and Personnel.

Members of the MI branch are able to promote, strike, and dismiss LRs.
This gives the opportunity to reward Low Ranks for their hard work.
However, this is only after they have successfully passed the Agency Academy Programme (AAP).

Next, I’ll give you a short quiz to assess what you’ve learnt.
You need 3/4 to pass. If you are unsure of the correct answer, just say ’pass’.
