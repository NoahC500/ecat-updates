The Executive branch is one of the four main branches of the UK and is run by the Cabinet Office.
It is made up of various ministries, departments, and offices, all with their own responsibilities.
To join the branch, one must be appointed to a position in the Executive.
This is done either by winning a General Election (and becoming PM) or by being appointed.
If a post opens up, one may send a letter of expression of interest (EOI) to the relevant department.
