# Some ECAT changes
## {BT}
- Changed rule two from `Do not swear excessively, spam, use colour chat, effects and dance.` to `Do not swear excessively, spam, use red or neon coloured chat, effects or dance.`

- Changed the post training line `If you are able to, please favourite the [UK] - Mi5 Access ID badge.` to `If you are able to, please favourite the [UK] - MI Access ID badge.`

## {Q}
- In S1 (New Recruits), change `They must be in uniform and not be wearing any accessories.` to `They must be in uniform and not be wearing any inappropriate accessories.` to reflect current uniform policy

- In S3 (VIPs), change `Veterans/VIP/Visitors are past, current or allied members of the The Government of the UK.` to `These people are past or allied members, or visitors to the UK.`

- Also in S3, change `Veterans and VIPs are required to wear one of the following:` from `wear` to `have`

- In the section about operating Sentry, change `To open the first door, you will need to use the right lever.` to be about the inner lever, as it is in HQ

- And `Once their identity has been verified, use the left lever to let them into HQ.` to be about the outer lever (Not completely sure about inner/outer wording, as could be confusing, hopefully not though when paired with the trainer doing it)

- Obviously also changing trainer instructions to reflect this, as well as quiz answers

- Change the end of script spiel to:
> Correct their answers
>
> Let me, or a member of MI know if you wish to take any further ECATs.
> Before we finish up, do you have any final questions?
> Answer any questions
>
> If candidate has now achieved enough ECATs to be promoted, feel free to do so
This makes it more consistent with other scripts

## {R}
- Change:
> When out recruiting, you should explain, to the best of your abilities, what the UK is.
> You could touch on things such as: the pay system, ranks structure, the courts system or roleplay.
> Although, you must not promise anything, such as a high rank, or extra pay or coins.
> If you are found to do so, you may be subject to disciplinary action.
> You could also mention such things as your personal experience.

to:
> When out recruiting, you should explain, to the best of your abilities, what the UK is.
> You could mention your personal experience, the pay system, or roleplay.
> However, you must never promise high ranks or pay, this will result in disciplinary action.

- Also changing the end spiel to the sorta stock one

## {D}

### Potential Punishments List
- For S3, add `or a peerage`

- For S6, add `to the plaintiff`

- Change Class B line to: `- Either-way Offences, where the maximum punishment is dismissal, minimum is one strike.`

- Change Class C line to: `- Summary Offences, where the maximum punishment is one strike, and where there is no minimum.`

- Change `If no class is specified for the committed crime, then it is up to the punisher to decide.` to `Where there is no defined class for an offence, the court may decide what punishment is appropriate.`

### Examples of Offences List

> Any questions before we start?

- Add end spiel post-quiz

# Suggestions
## {Q}
- Remove `Please make sure their badge is owned by Terrorization or HM-Government, as trolls can create fake badges.` from Section 2, as it is already specified in the main rules

- Also shift away from the 1. Trainees, 2. LRs, etc. system
Could maybe have a list(?) then delve into the rest

## {R}
- Merge Qs 3 & 4, [detailed on live doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ldHYxfwtp0SNHZgZHkJ_lX97rm3ou1tSULFUT4dV9Mc/edit?disco=AAABNF3vH_o)
